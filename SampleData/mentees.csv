Currently, being an intern at a hospital has given me a chance to interact with health professionals; however, I think that broadening my network will help me in the long run.

In addition, they can guide me on how to overcome my weaknesses and provide constructive criticism when evaluating me on a professional level. Also, one of the most important things that made me interested in this is that mentors will be able to keep me on track and motivate me to look for new opportunities and make sure that I am aware of the real-world things that are happening in the industry.

This project aims to increase student success among CSUSM Chemistry and Biochemistry majors by linking scholarships with effective support activities. Key to this project is the formation of a Chemistry & Biochemistry Targeted Learning Community (CB-TLC). Project activities include: (i) peer, faculty, and professional mentoring, (ii) academic and professional workshops, (iii) enhanced opportunities for undergraduate research, and (iv) priority enrollment status in chemistry courses.
